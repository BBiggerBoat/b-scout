# B-Atlas Organic Search Foundations — v6.27.0

Generated search surfaces:

- `/models/` — permanent crawlable model guides
- `/manufacturers/` — manufacturer model directories (2+ models in current B-Atlas data)
- `/boats/` — curated buyer-constraint pages, not arbitrary faceted URLs
- `/compare/` — deliberately limited model comparisons

## Core rule

Do not generate every possible combination of filters. Search landing pages should exist only where the page is a useful buyer destination with a stable URL and a clear purpose.

## Data semantics

Constraint pages list **known matches only**. A model with missing data is not declared unsuitable; it simply cannot be asserted to match that specific public landing page.

## Regeneration

Run `python developer/generate-search-landing-pages.py` after material changes to `boatmodels.json`. Review generated pages before deployment.
